This repo contains MATLAB codes to implment basis function selection algorithm as well as make comparison among Local Kriging, Fixed Rank Kriging, and Fused Gaussian Process. For details, see the paper titled "Spatial Statistical Downscaling for Constructing High-Resolution Nature Runs in Global Observing System Simulation Experiments" by Ma at al. (2019) ([DOI:10.1080/00401706.2018.1524791](https://doi.org/10.1080/00401706.2018.1524791)).
